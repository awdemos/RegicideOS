# Implementation Plan: PortCL Comprehensive Test Suite

**Branch**: `004-portcl-test-suite` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [`/specs/004-portcl-test-suite/spec.md`](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-portcl-test-suite/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement comprehensive test suite for PortCL AI agent achieving 90%+ code coverage across working components (error handling, serde utilities, core utilities). Test infrastructure includes unit tests, integration tests, performance benchmarks, and property-based testing with comprehensive documentation and fixtures.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+
**Primary Dependencies**: tokio, serde, tempfile, mockall, criterion, pretty_assertions, proptest, test-log
**Storage**: Files (test data, fixtures, configuration)
**Testing**: cargo test with tarpaulin for coverage reporting
**Target Platform**: Linux (RegicideOS target platform)
**Project Type**: Single project (test suite for existing PortCL library)
**Performance Goals**: Test suite execution < 2 minutes, sub-second response times for individual tests
**Constraints**: Must work with existing PortCL codebase, optional ML dependencies not required for basic testing
**Scale/Scope**: Focus on working components (error handling, serde, core utilities), foundation for future expansion

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [1] (test suite - single focused project)
- Using framework directly? (yes - cargo test directly)
- Single data model? (yes - test data structures, no DTOs)
- Avoiding patterns? (yes - no Repository/UoW, direct testing approach)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (yes - PortCL library with separate test suite)
- Libraries listed: [PortCL library + test suite as separate concern]
- CLI per library: [N/A - this is a test suite, not a CLI application]
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned? (no - standard Rust documentation)

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (yes - all tests must fail first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? (yes - TDD approach)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit followed? (yes - Unit→Integration→Performance)
- Real dependencies used? (yes - actual file I/O, real serialization)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? (yes)
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase (strictly enforced)

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? (yes - test-log integration)
- Frontend logs → backend? (unified stream - test output collection)
- Error context sufficient? (yes - comprehensive error testing)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (test suite follows PortCL versioning)
- BUILD increments on every change? (yes)
- Breaking changes handled? (parallel tests, migration plan)

**Structure Decision**: DEFAULT to Option 1 - Single project extending existing PortCL test structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Test dependency compatibility with existing PortCL Cargo.toml
   - Performance benchmarking approaches for Rust test suites
   - Property-based testing patterns for validation utilities
   - Integration testing strategies for async components

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research test dependency compatibility for PortCL project"
   Task: "Find best practices for Rust performance benchmarking"
   Task: "Research property-based testing patterns for validation utilities"
   Task: "Research async integration testing strategies for Rust"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Test configuration entities
   - Mock data structures for PortCL components
   - Test result and benchmark data models
   - Performance metric entities

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Test management API endpoints
   - Coverage reporting endpoints
   - Benchmark result endpoints
   - Use OpenAPI 3.0 specification
   - Output to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Developer workflow scenarios
   - Maintainer validation scenarios
   - Administrator confidence scenarios
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for Claude Code
   - Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Focus on test infrastructure and working components first
- Create contract tests from API specifications
- Generate implementation tasks following TDD principles

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **TDD Order**: Test fixtures → Unit tests → Integration tests → Performance tests
- **Dependency Order**: Infrastructure → Core modules → Advanced features
- **Parallel Execution**: Mark independent tasks with [P] for concurrent development

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None identified | N/A | Constitution compliance achieved |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS (All design artifacts align with constitution)
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
