# Tasks: PortCL Comprehensive Test Suite

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-portcl-test-suite/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/test-suite-api.yaml, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 25+ entities → model tasks
   → contracts/test-suite-api.yaml: Extract 8 API endpoints → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract testing decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract test scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: test infrastructure, dependencies, configuration
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, unit tests (TDD first)
   → Core: test data models, mock structures, helpers
   → Integration: component interactions, async workflows
   → Polish: performance benchmarks, coverage, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
```

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All API endpoints have corresponding contract tests
- [ ] All data model entities have implementation tasks
- [ ] All tests written before implementation (TDD)
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent (no file conflicts)
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] Coverage targets met (100% for error/serde, 95% for core utils)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Documentation complete and updated

## Success Criteria
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ overall, 100% for error handling and serde utilities, 95% for core utilities
- **Test Quality**: All tests follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- **Performance**: Test suite execution < 2 minutes
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive test suite documentation
- **Maintainability**: Clear organization and naming conventions

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (RED phase)
- Commit after each task to track progress
- Focus on working components first (error handling, serde, core utils)
- Test infrastructure designed for future expansion
- Constitution compliance maintained throughout
