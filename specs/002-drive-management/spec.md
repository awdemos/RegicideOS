# Feature Specification: Drive Management

**Feature Branch**: `[002-drive-management]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Drive partitioning, formatting, and btrfs layout management for UEFI systems"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want the installer to automatically partition and format drives with btrfs-compatible layouts, so that I can have a properly configured system without manual disk management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid target drive, **When** installation starts, **Then** the system must create an EFI system partition (512MB) formatted as vfat
2. **Given** btrfs layout selection, **When** partitioning completes, **Then** the system must create root partition with required subvolumes
3. **Given** encrypted btrfs layout, **When** formatting completes, **Then** the system must configure LUKS encryption with btrfs subvolumes
4. **Given** existing partitions, **When** installation starts, **Then** the system must wipe and repartition the entire drive

### Edge Cases
- What happens when drive has existing LVM volumes?
- How does system handle drives with bad sectors?
- What happens when partitioning fails due to disk errors?
- How does system handle drive size calculations for percentage-based partitions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support btrfs partition layout with EFI system partition and btrfs root
- **FR-002**: System MUST support btrfs_encryption_dev layout with LUKS encryption
- **FR-003**: System MUST create EFI system partition of exactly 512MB formatted as vfat
- **FR-004**: System MUST create btrfs root partition with standard subvolumes (/home, /overlay, /overlay/etc, /overlay/var, /overlay/usr)
- **FR-005**: System MUST support LUKS encryption for btrfs partitions with secure key management
- **FR-006**: System MUST unmount any existing mount points on target drive before partitioning
- **FR-007**: System MUST deactivate any existing LVM volume groups on target drive
- **FR-008**: System MUST create GPT partition table on target drive
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle percentage-based partition sizing correctly
- **FR-010**: System MUST format each partition according to its designated filesystem type
- **FR-011**: System MUST create btrfs subvolumes after formatting btrfs partitions
- **FR-012**: System MUST set appropriate filesystem labels for all partitions

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST complete drive preparation in under 5 minutes
- **NFR-002**: System MUST provide clear error messages for partitioning failures
- **NFR-003**: System MUST validate partition layout before applying changes
- **NFR-004**: System MUST handle drives of varying sizes correctly (12GB to multi-TB)

### Constraints
- **CON-001**: Only btrfs-compatible layouts are supported (btrfs, btrfs_encryption_dev)
- **CON-002**: Traditional and LVM layouts without btrfs are not permitted
- **CON-003**: EFI system partition must be exactly 512MB vfat
- **CON-004**: All partitions must be properly labeled for identification
- **CON-005**: Entire drive is wiped and repartitioned (no dual-boot support)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Drive Layout**: Defines partition scheme, sizes, filesystem types, and encryption settings
- **Partition**: Represents individual partition with size, type, format, and label
- **Encryption Configuration**: Contains LUKS encryption settings and key management
- **Subvolume**: Represents btrfs subvolume with mount point configuration
