# Feature Specification: System Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `[003-system-deployment]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Root image download, mounting, bootloader installation, and post-install configuration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want the installer to download and deploy the Xenia Linux root image with proper bootloader configuration, so that I can have a bootable system after installation completes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid root image URL, **When** download starts, **Then** the system must download the .img file to the correct location
2. **Given** downloaded root image, **When** mounting begins, **Then** the system must mount roots partition and loop-mount the squashfs image
3. **Given** mounted root system, **When** bootloader installation starts, **Then** the system must install GRUB with UEFI support
4. **Given** installed bootloader, **When** post-install runs, **Then** the system must complete any required system configuration

### Edge Cases
- What happens when root image download fails or is corrupted?
- How does system handle insufficient disk space during download?
- What happens when bootloader installation fails?
- How does system handle interrupted post-installation tasks?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST download root image from specified URL to /mnt/gentoo/root.img
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove existing root image before downloading new one
- **FR-003**: System MUST create and mount roots partition on /mnt/gentoo
- **FR-004**: System MUST loop-mount squashfs root image on /mnt/root
- **FR-005**: System MUST mount EFI partition on /mnt/root/boot/efi
- **FR-006**: System MUST mount virtual filesystems (proc, dev, sys, run) in chroot environment
- **FR-007**: System MUST install GRUB bootloader with UEFI support and LVM modules
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate GRUB configuration file
- **FR-009**: System MUST execute post-installation tasks within chroot environment
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle download interruptions and network failures gracefully
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate downloaded image integrity
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide progress feedback during long-running operations

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST download images at maximum available network speed
- **NFR-002**: System MUST resume interrupted downloads when possible
- **NFR-003**: System MUST provide clear progress indicators for all operations
- **NFR-004**: System MUST complete deployment in under 20 minutes (excluding download time)
- **NFR-005**: System MUST handle network timeouts and retry failed downloads

### Constraints
- **CON-001**: Root image must be in squashfs .img format
- **CON-002**: Only UEFI GRUB installation is supported (no legacy GRUB)
- **CON-003**: Download URL must use HTTP/HTTPS protocol
- **CON-004**: System must validate image before mounting
- **CON-005**: All operations must be atomic or recoverable

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Root Image**: Contains the compressed system filesystem and configuration
- **Mount Configuration**: Defines mount points and options for system deployment
- **Bootloader Configuration**: Contains GRUB settings and UEFI boot entries
- **Deployment State**: Tracks progress of system deployment and installation phases
