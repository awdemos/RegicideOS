# Feature Specification: UEFI Installer

**Feature Branch**: `[001-uefi-installer]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "UEFI-only system installer with TUI interface and btrfs requirement"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want to install Xenia Linux on a UEFI system using a text-based interface, so that I can quickly set up the operating system with the required btrfs filesystem.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a UEFI system with sufficient disk space, **When** I run the installer, **Then** it must detect and validate UEFI firmware
2. **Given** valid configuration parameters, **When** I use automated mode, **Then** the installer must proceed without user interaction
3. **Given** missing or invalid configuration, **When** using interactive mode, **Then** the installer must prompt for valid values with defaults shown
4. **Given** a BIOS system, **When** I run the installer, **Then** it must fail with a clear UEFI requirement message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when system has both UEFI and CSM (legacy boot)?
- How does installer handle interrupted installation?
- What happens when target drive is too small (<12GB)?
- How does installer handle existing partitions on target drive?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect and validate UEFI firmware presence before proceeding
- **FR-002**: System MUST refuse to run on BIOS-only systems with clear error message
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide text-based user interface for interactive configuration
- **FR-004**: System MUST support automated installation via TOML configuration file
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that selected filesystem is btrfs-compatible
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate target drive meets minimum size requirements (12GB+)
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate root image URL accessibility and format
- **FR-008**: System MUST warn user before destructive drive operations begin
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide color-coded logging for operation status
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle configuration validation with interactive fallback

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST complete installation in under 30 minutes on standard hardware
- **NFR-002**: System MUST provide clear error messages for all failure conditions
- **NFR-003**: System MUST not proceed without explicit user confirmation for destructive operations
- **NFR-004**: System MUST validate all inputs before starting installation process

### Constraints
- **CON-001**: BIOS systems are explicitly unsupported due to btrfs requirements
- **CON-002**: Only btrfs-compatible filesystem layouts are permitted
- **CON-003**: Minimum drive size of 12GB is enforced
- **CON-004**: Root image must be in .img format and accessible via HTTP/HTTPS

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Installation Configuration**: Contains drive selection, root image URL, filesystem type
- **System Environment**: Contains UEFI status, available drives, system resources
- **Installation State**: Tracks current installation phase, success/failure status
