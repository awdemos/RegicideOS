# RegicideOS Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Rust-First Architecture
Every system component that can be implemented in Rust MUST be migrated to Rust. Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, and documented. Clear technical purpose is required - no organizational-only libraries. Memory safety and performance through Rust's ownership model and zero-cost abstractions are non-negotiable.

### II. AI-First System Design
Artificial intelligence capabilities MUST be integrated at the system level, not as add-ons. All AI agents must use continual reinforcement learning techniques for autonomous optimization. Intelligent system management, predictive maintenance, and context-aware user assistance are core requirements, not optional features.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory: Tests MUST be written → User approved → Tests MUST fail → Then implement. Red-Green-Refactor cycle MUST be strictly enforced. All integration tests MUST pass before any feature is considered complete. Real dependencies MUST be used in testing - no mocking of core system components.

### IV. Immutable System Architecture
The system MUST maintain a read-only root filesystem using BTRFS for enhanced security and stability. Atomic updates and rollback capability MUST be preserved. Overlay-based package management MUST be used to maintain system integrity while allowing user customization.

### V. Library-First Design
Every feature MUST start as a standalone library. Libraries MUST be self-contained, independently testable, and documented. Clear purpose is required - no organizational-only libraries. Every library MUST expose functionality via CLI interface with stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr protocol, supporting both JSON and human-readable formats.

### VI. Integration Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Integration tests MUST be implemented for: new library contract tests, contract changes, inter-service communication, and shared schemas. Focus areas MUST include cross-component workflows, error propagation, async execution coordination, and serialization workflows.

### VII. Observability & Monitoring
Structured logging MUST be implemented throughout the system. Performance monitoring MUST include throughput, latency, and resource utilization metrics. AI agent behavior MUST be observable and auditable. Frontend logs MUST stream to backend unified logging system.

### VIII. Future-Proof Evolution
Architecture MUST support kernel transition to Asterinas as it matures. System MUST be container-native with built-in workflow isolation. Design decisions MUST consider long-term maintainability and extensibility, not just immediate functionality.

## Technical Standards

### System Architecture Requirements
- **Kernel**: Linux with transition path to Asterinas
- **Filesystem**: BTRFS with read-only root and writable overlays
- **Package Management**: Overlay-based system with AI optimization
- **Desktop Environment**: Cosmic Desktop (Wayland-native, Rust-based)
- **Container Runtime**: Distrobox for application isolation

### AI Agent Standards
- **Learning Framework**: Continual Reinforcement Learning
- **Communication**: Standardized inter-agent protocols
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability and audit trails
- **Coordination**: Multi-agent conflict resolution systems
- **Safety**: Action validation and rollback capabilities

### Quality Assurance Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ overall, 100% for error handling and serialization
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for user interactions
- **Security**: Memory safety through Rust, minimal privilege design
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical specifications and user guides

## Development Workflow

### Spec-Driven Development Lifecycle
1. **Specification**: User requirements MUST be documented in feature specifications
2. **Planning**: Technical approach MUST be documented in implementation plans
3. **Research**: Technical decisions MUST be researched and justified
4. **Task Generation**: Implementation MUST be broken into executable tasks
5. **Implementation**: Tasks MUST be executed following constitutional principles
6. **Validation**: All tests MUST pass and requirements MUST be verified

### Code Quality Standards
- **Style**: Rust API Guidelines MUST be followed
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper context
- **Documentation**: All public APIs MUST be documented
- **Testing**: TDD MUST be followed for all new development
- **Performance**: Benchmarks MUST be established for critical paths

### Versioning & Release Management
- **Version Format**: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD with semantic versioning
- **Breaking Changes**: MUST increment MAJOR version with migration plan
- **Features**: New functionality MUST increment MINOR version
- **Bug Fixes**: MUST increment BUILD version
- **AI Agents**: MUST follow independent versioning with coordination compatibility

## Governance

### Constitution Supremacy
This constitution supersedes all other development practices, technical decisions, and architectural choices. Any deviation MUST be explicitly justified and documented in complexity tracking.

### Amendment Process
- **Proposal**: Amendments MUST be submitted as documented change requests
- **Review**: Technical review MUST assess compliance with core principles
- **Approval**: Amendments MUST be approved by project maintainers
- **Implementation**: Amendments MUST include migration plan for existing code
- **Documentation**: All amendments MUST be documented with clear rationale

### Compliance & Review
- **Automated Validation**: Constitution compliance MUST be validated in CI/CD
- **Manual Review**: All pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance
- **Complexity Tracking**: Justification MUST be documented for any deviations
- **Template Updates**: All project templates MUST align with constitutional principles

### Runtime Guidance
- **Development**: Constitution principles MUST guide daily development decisions
- **Technical Debt**: Constitution violations MUST be tracked and resolved
- **Innovation**: New technologies MUST be evaluated against constitutional principles
- **Community**: External contributions MUST adhere to constitutional standards

**Version**: 1.0.1 | **Ratified**: 2025-09-20 | **Last Amended**: 2025-09-21
