# Async Workflows Integration Tests

## Overview
This module contains comprehensive integration tests for async workflows in the PortCL system. These tests validate async test execution workflows, concurrent operations, resource management, error handling, and performance characteristics.

## Test Coverage

### Primary Test Functions (14 total)
1. `test_concurrent_test_execution` - Tests concurrent execution coordination
2. `test_async_resource_management` - Tests async resource allocation and cleanup
3. `test_async_error_handling_and_propagation` - Tests error propagation through async call chains
4. `test_async_timeout_handling` - Tests timeout behavior for async operations
5. `test_async_cancellation_and_cleanup` - Tests cancellation and resource cleanup
6. `test_async_performance_and_throughput` - Tests performance under load
7. `test_async_dependency_management` - Tests async dependency resolution
8. `test_async_workflow_orchestration` - Tests complex async workflows
9. `test_async_resource_pooling` - Tests connection pooling and resource reuse
10. `test_async_backpressure` - Tests flow control under high load
11. `test_load_conditions` - Helper for testing different load scenarios
12. `test_with_cancellation` - Helper for testing cancellation scenarios
13. `test_with_retry` - Helper for testing retry logic
14. `test_concurrent_operations` - Helper for testing concurrent execution

### TDD Compliance
- **RED Phase**: All tests are designed to fail initially
- **Failing Assertions**: Each test contains specific assertions that should fail due to missing implementation
- **Error Messages**: Tests check for specific error types and context that don't exist yet
- **Metrics Validation**: Tests verify metrics collection that isn't implemented

### Async Features Tested
- **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple async operations running simultaneously
- **Resource Management**: Proper allocation, cleanup, and leak prevention
- **Error Propagation**: Error handling through async call chains
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper timeout behavior and cleanup
- **Cancellation**: Graceful cancellation and resource cleanup
- **Performance**: Throughput, latency, and efficiency metrics
- **Dependency Management**: Async dependency resolution and deadlock prevention
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Complex multi-step async workflows
- **Resource Pooling**: Connection pooling and resource reuse
- **Backpressure**: Flow control under high load conditions

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Test file created: `/Users/a/code/RegicideOS/ai-agents/portcl/tests/integration/test_async_workflows.rs`
- ✅ Module integration: Added to `tests/integration/mod.rs`
- ✅ TDD RED phase: Tests fail as expected due to missing implementation
- ✅ Documentation: Comprehensive comments and documentation
- ⏳ Implementation: Ready for GREEN phase (implementation to make tests pass)

## File Statistics
- **Total Lines**: 748
- **Test Functions**: 14 async test functions
- **Helper Functions**: 3 utility functions
- **TDD Markers**: 10 "should fail" comments indicating missing implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Covers all major async workflow scenarios

## Dependencies Used
- `tokio` for async runtime
- `futures` for async utilities
- `tracing` for structured logging
- `tempfile` for test isolation
- `serial_test` for test serialization
- `parking_lot` for async synchronization
- `std::sync::atomic` for thread-safe counters

## Next Steps
1. **GREEN Phase**: Implement the missing functionality to make tests pass
2. **REFACTOR Phase**: Optimize and improve the implementation
3. **Integration**: Ensure tests work with the broader PortCL system
4. **Performance**: Validate performance characteristics meet requirements

## Test Execution
```bash
# Run all integration tests (will fail in RED phase)
cargo test --lib

# Run specific async workflows tests (will fail in RED phase)
cargo test --lib async_workflows
```

## Notes
- All tests follow TDD principles and should fail initially
- Tests are designed to be comprehensive and cover edge cases
- Proper error handling and resource cleanup is emphasized
- Performance and scalability considerations are included
- Tests use proper async patterns and best practices
