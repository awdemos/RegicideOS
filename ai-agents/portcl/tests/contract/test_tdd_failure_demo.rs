//! TDD Failure Demonstration for GET /coverage API endpoint
//!
//! This demonstrates the RED phase of TDD where the test fails because
//! the actual API implementation doesn't exist yet.

// This test demonstrates the TDD principle - it should FAIL initially
// because no implementation exists for the GET /coverage endpoint

// NOTE: This would normally be an integration test that makes actual HTTP calls
// but since we're following TDD, we show it failing because no service exists

#[test]
fn test_tdd_failure_no_implementation() {
    // This test demonstrates what would happen in a real TDD scenario
    // where we try to test an API that hasn't been implemented yet

    // In a real integration test, this would be:
    // let response = reqwest::get("http://localhost:8080/coverage").await.unwrap();
    // assert!(response.status().is_success());

    // Since no implementation exists, this would fail with:
    // - Connection refused (no server running)
    // - 404 Not Found (endpoint not implemented)
    // - 500 Internal Server Error (incomplete implementation)

    // For demonstration, we simulate the failure
    let server_running = false;
    let endpoint_implemented = false;

    // This assertion would fail in TDD RED phase
    assert!(server_running, "FAIL: Server is not running (TDD RED phase)");
    assert!(endpoint_implemented, "FAIL: Endpoint /coverage is not implemented (TDD RED phase)");

    // This demonstrates the TDD philosophy:
    // 1. Write failing test (RED)
    // 2. Write minimal implementation to make test pass (GREEN)
    // 3. Refactor (REFACTOR)

    println!("✓ TDD failure demonstrated - test fails as expected");
    println!("✓ Next step: implement minimal API endpoint to make test pass");
    println!("✓ Then: refactor to improve implementation");
