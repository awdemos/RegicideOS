## üåü Overview

RegicideOS is a forward-looking Linux distribution that has begun as a fork of Xenia Linux with a clear vision: to create an **AI-first, Rust-powered operating system** designed for the future of computing.

Our mission is to build a secure, performant, and intelligent operating system where every component that can be implemented in Rust will be migrated to Rust, and AI capabilities are integrated at the system level.

`Regicide` in this case refers strictly to the `"kings"` of the current operating system marketplace: Microsoft, unsafe programming languages, and human-centric system administration, and has no further social or political ramifications
implied.

Motivational slogan:

> "The commits will keep coming until every single Red Hat Enterprise customer cancels their subscription."

## üéØ Core Principles

### üîß Rust-First Philosophy
- **System-wide Rust adoption**: Every component that can be replaced with Rust binaries will be migrated
- **Memory safety**: Eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities through Rust's ownership model
- **Performance**: Leverage Rust's zero-cost abstractions for optimal system performance

### ü§ñ AI Integration
- **Intelligent system management**: AI-driven optimization and resource allocation utilizing Reenforcement Learning
- **Predictive maintenance**: Proactive system health monitoring and issue resolution 
- **User assistance**: Context-aware help and automation capabilities
- **Continual Reinforcement Learning**: Inspired by the techniques listed in [A Survey of Continual Reinforcement Learning
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21872)

### üîÆ Future-Proof Architecture
- **Kernel transition**: Readiness for migration to the [Asterinas kernel](https://asterinas.github.io/) as it matures
- **Immutable system**: Read-only BTRFS filesystem for enhanced security and stability
- **Container-native**: Built around containerized workflows for application isolation

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- 64-bit x86 processor
- 12GB disk space minimum (20GB recommended)
- UEFI or Legacy BIOS firmware
- Internet connection

### Installation Steps

**Step 1: Boot Live Environment**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: You must boot into a Linux live CD/USB environment to install RegicideOS. The minimal installer requires Rust toolchain to be available.

**Recommended Live Environments:**
- **Fedora Workstation Live**: https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/
- **Ubuntu Live**: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop
- **Arch Linux Live**: https://archlinux.org/download/

Boot your target machine from the live environment and connect to the internet.

**Step 2: Quick Install (Recommended)**

For the fastest installation, use our pre-built minimal installer binary:

```bash
# Download the pre-built installer
curl -L -o regicide-installer https://github.com/awdemos/RegicideOS/releases/latest/download/regicide-installer

# Make executable and run
chmod +x regicide-installer
sudo ./regicide-installer
```

**Step 3: Manual Install (Advanced)**

If you need to build from source or use a custom configuration:

```bash
# Install required packages in live environment
# For Fedora:
sudo dnf install git curl gcc btrfs-progs

# For Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git curl gcc btrfs-progs

# For Arch:
sudo pacman -S git curl gcc btrfs-progs

# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/awdemos/RegicideOS.git
cd RegicideOS/installer
cargo build --release
sudo ./target/release/installer
```

### Installation Configuration

The installer defaults to minimal packages only (no recommended packages) and BTRFS filesystem. Common configurations:

#### Interactive Mode (Default)
```bash
sudo ./regicide-installer
# or for manual build:
sudo ./target/release/installer
```
The installer will guide you through:
- Disk selection and partitioning
- Username and password setup
- Minimal package installation (no recommended packages)
- BTRFS subvolume configuration

#### Automated Installation
```bash
# Create minimal configuration
cat > regicide-config.toml << EOF
drive = "/dev/sda"
repository = "https://repo.xenialinux.com/releases/"
flavour = "minimal"  # Uses minimal packages only
release_branch = "main"
filesystem = "btrfs"
username = "your-username"
applications = "minimal"  # IMPORTANT: No recommended packages
EOF

# Run automated installation
sudo ./regicide-installer -c regicide-config.toml
```

#### Live Environment Requirements
- **Live OS**: Any modern Linux live environment (Fedora recommended)
- **Storage**: Target drive will be completely erased and reformatted
- **Network**: Required for downloading system image from Xenia repository
- **Time**: 15-30 minutes depending on internet speed

### Post-Installation

After installation completes:

1. **Reboot** into your new RegicideOS system
2. **Login** with your created username and password
3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   systemctl status
   cat /etc/os-release

   # Verify BTRFS setup
   sudo btrfs filesystem df /
   sudo btrfs subvolume list /

   # Check BtrMind service (if AI tools installed)
   systemctl status btrmind
   ```

### Troubleshooting

#### Rust Toolchain Issues
If the pre-built installer fails, ensure Rust is properly installed:
```bash
# Verify Rust installation
rustc --version
cargo --version

# If not installed:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env
```

#### BTRFS Creation Issues
The installer includes comprehensive BTRFS validation:
- Subvolume structure verification
- Proper mount point configuration
- Compression and optimization settings
- Read-only root with writable overlays

#### Network Issues
If downloading from Xenia repository fails:
```bash
# Test connectivity
ping repo.xenialinux.com

# Use alternative mirror if needed
# In config file, set: repository = "https://mirror.xenialinux.com/releases/"
```
